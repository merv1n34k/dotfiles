# Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal .files! For now I only have my nvim configuration *(completely written in lua)*.

If you liked it, feel free to use any parts of it, or maybe give an advice how to improve it :)

# ROADMAP

- [ ] Update READMEs, provide documentation
- [ ] Further nvim config improvements
